# How do I use this installer? 

## Make sure you have Python installed, get it below:
- [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- [Mac OS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
- [Other](https://www.python.org/download/other/)

### On Linux? 
Python is ususally preinstalled, but if not just run `apt install python` or `sudo apt install python`



## Once you've installed Python
DOuble click `mod_installer.py`, a terminal window will pop up and update you on the progress! 

## Done! Enjoy the modpack
